          “You want to wake up in the morning and think the future is going to
          be great - and that's what being a spacefaring civilization is all
          about. It's about believing in the future and thinking that the future
          will be better than the past. And I can't think of anything more
          exciting than going out there and being among the stars.” -Elon Musk

              Earth orbit, the Moon, Mars and beyond. Starship is the world's
              most powerful launch vehicle ever developed, capable of carrying
              up to 150 metric tonnes fully reusable and 250 metric tonnes

              Falcon Heavy is composed of three reusable Falcon 9 nine-engine
              cores whose 27 Merlin engines together generate more than 5
              million pounds of thrust at liftoff, equal to approximately
              eighteen 747 aircraft. As one of the world's most powerful
              operational rockets, Falcon Heavy can lift nearly 64 metric tons
              (141,000 lbs) to orbit.

              Falcon 9 is a reusable, two-stage rocket designed and manufactured
              by SpaceX for the reliable and safe transport of people and
              payloads into Earth orbit and beyond. Falcon 9 is the world's
              first orbital class reusable rocket. Reusability allows SpaceX to
              refly the most expensive parts of the rocket, which in turn drives
              down the cost of space access.
